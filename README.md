# Go CD API Documentation

[![Build Status](https://snap-ci.com/gocd/api.go.cd/branch/master/build_image)](https://snap-ci.com/gocd/api.go.cd/branch/master)

Checkout the live documentation at https://api.gocd.io

# Contributing to the API Documentation

### Configure and install middleman

```
$ bundle install --path .bundle --binstubs
```

### Serve the documentation locally

```
$ ./bin/middleman server
```

### Generating the static website

```
$ ./bin/rake build
```

### Publish the website to Github Pages

```
$ ./bin/rake publish
```

### Releasing a new version of the API

In this example we'll be releasing version 15.3.0 and setting up master so any new changes from this point go to 16.1.0.

Create a branch for your existing version that you will be releasing

```
git checkout -b 15.3.0
git push upstream 15.3.0
```

Create a new pipeline for this branch on snap-ci.com so any new changes to the 15.3.0 branch are pushed to the correct directory on `gh-pages` branch.

Now bump the version in `config.rb` on the master branch.

```
$ git checkout master
$ vim config.rb                  # Bump version in `build_dir` to `16.1.0`, master is now effectively 16.1.0 (the next release)
$ git add config.rb
$ git commit -m 'Bump version'
$ git push upstream master
```

Now wait for site to publish via CI (takes a minute), or publish it yourself `./bin/rake publish`. Once the new version is published

```
$ git fetch --all
$ git checkout gh-pages
$ git merge upstream/gh-pages
$ vim versions.json             # edit file and add a new version, set its "type" to "latest", remove the "type" attribute on older version.
$ ln -sf 15.3.0 current        # current is now a symlink to 15.3.0
$ git add versions.json current
$ git commit -m 'Add new version to dropdown'
$ git push
```
